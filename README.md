Memento for Android Wear

Momentary event marking functionality along with two categories of assessment surveys on the watch;
First category is the "Momentary Survey"; which follows the event marking, and collects descriptive info about the marked event.
Second category is the "Summary Survey"; which is prompted at the end-of-day or any scheduled time, and collects summary info about the context and dynamics.

Beyond these, this version also adds sensing and optimization!
Motion (accelerometer and pedometer), heart rate (PPG), and location (Estimote proximity beacons) are sensed on different schedules and duty cycles, and stored locally.
